Variations include pudding fudge cake, made with chocolate cake mix, chocolate pudding, and chocolate chips. When made with additional chocolate, the recipe is sometimes known as "Death by Chocolate".[1]

"Fudge cake" is also a term in the American South to refer to a dense, single-layer chocolate cake served with or without icing. It is similar to a brownie, although more moist with more chocolate.[2]
